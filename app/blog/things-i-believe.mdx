## Shipping fast beats the best strategy

- Speed is a superpower
- Create a bias toward shipping
- Small teams ship faster
- AI-native teams will move 10x faster than those not willing to change
- Landings > launches (i.e. product adoption > shipping code)
- Listen, build, ship, tell the customer, then repeat forever

## You have no career ceiling

- Grit > talent
- There’s no substitute for putting in the hours
- Get 1% better every day

## On Building Products

Ship early, ship often. Perfection is the enemy of progress. The best way to learn what users want is to put something in their hands and watch how they use it.

Listen to feedback, but don't build everything users ask for. Your job is to understand the problem they're trying to solve, not implement their solution. Users know what hurts, not necessarily how to fix it.

## On Writing and Teaching

Teaching is the best way to learn. When you can explain something simply, you truly understand it. Writing forces you to clarify your thoughts and find gaps in your knowledge.

Good technical writing is conversational, not academic. Use simple words. Keep sentences short. Break up walls of text. Your goal is to make complex topics feel approachable.

## On Career and Growth

Your career is a long game. Don't optimize for titles or compensation in the short term. Optimize for learning, impact, and working with great people. The rest will follow.

Side projects are underrated. They're where you can experiment without consequences, learn new technologies, and build things that might turn into something bigger.

## On Technology Choices

Use boring technology. Pick the tool that's been battle-tested, well-documented, and has a strong community. Being productive matters more than being on the cutting edge.

That said, stay curious. Keep learning new things. Just be deliberate about when you introduce new technology into production systems.
