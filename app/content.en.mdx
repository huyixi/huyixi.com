I'm a designer, developer and writer. 

I like making things simple. My interests span a broad spectrum of subjects, encompassing web development, book reading, fitness.

I’ve built several apps that have been incredibly useful to me — and perhaps you’ll find them helpful too. You can explore all the apps I’ve created on my personal app store.
